# Multi-Applicant UX Recommendation

## **Best UX Approach: Extended Single-Step with Applicant Selector**

After analyzing the current codebase and considering user experience, here's the **most practical and user-friendly approach**:

### **Recommended Implementation: Smart Applicant Context Switching**

Instead of restructuring the entire data model, I recommend:

1. **Add Applicant Selector to Existing Steps 3 & 4**
   - Keep current form structure intact
   - Add a prominent applicant selector at the top
   - Show clear context about which applicant's data is being collected
   - Save data per applicant automatically

2. **Visual Progress Tracking**
   - Show completion status for each applicant
   - Clear indicators of who still needs to complete their information
   - Allow jumping between applicants

3. **Smart Validation**
   - Require completion for all applicants before proceeding
   - Show which applicants still need attention
   - Validate per applicant, not globally

### **Why This Approach is Best:**

✅ **Minimal Code Changes**: Works with existing components
✅ **Familiar UX**: Users understand single-form approach
✅ **Clear Context**: Always know which applicant you're filling for
✅ **Progressive**: Can complete applicants one at a time
✅ **Flexible**: Can go back and edit any applicant
✅ **Validation**: Clear feedback on completion status

### **Implementation Steps:**

1. **Add Applicant Selector Component** 
   - Tabs or dropdown to switch between applicants
   - Visual completion indicators
   - Clear context display

2. **Extend Store with Co-Applicant Data**
   - Add `co_applicants` arrays to step3 and step4
   - Keep primary applicant data in current structure
   - Auto-sync when switching applicants

3. **Update Navigation Logic**
   - Check all applicants are complete before allowing "Next"
   - Show clear error messages about incomplete applicants
   - Allow partial completion and returning later

4. **Add Progress Indicators**
   - Show "2 of 3 applicants completed" type messaging
   - Visual checkmarks for completed applicants
   - Clear call-to-action for incomplete ones

### **Example UX Flow:**

```
Step 3: Home & Financial Information

[Primary Applicant ✓] [John Smith ✓] [Jane Doe ⏳]

Currently filling for: Jane Doe

[Your Current Home form fields here...]

Status: 2 of 3 applicants completed
Next: Complete Jane Doe's information to continue
```
