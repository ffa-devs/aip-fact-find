## Multi-Applicant Steps 3 & 4 - UX Implementation Plan

### **Approach: Context-Aware Progressive Forms**

Instead of completely restructuring the data model, I recommend a **UX-first approach** that provides the best user experience while maintaining data integrity.

### **Key UX Principles:**

1. **Progressive Disclosure**: Show one applicant at a time to avoid cognitive overload
2. **Clear Context**: Always show which applicant's information is being collected
3. **Progress Tracking**: Visual indicators of completion status
4. **Flexible Navigation**: Allow jumping between applicants
5. **Validation Per Applicant**: Ensure each applicant's data is complete before proceeding

### **Implementation Strategy:**

#### **Option 1: Tab-Based Multi-Applicant Forms (Recommended)**

**Advantages:**
- ✅ Clear visual separation of applicants
- ✅ Easy to track completion status
- ✅ Familiar UI pattern
- ✅ Can handle any number of co-applicants
- ✅ Allows partial completion and returning later

**Implementation:**
- Create a wrapper component that handles applicant switching
- Show tabs for Primary + each co-applicant
- Visual completion indicators (checkmarks, progress bars)
- Validate per applicant, not globally

#### **Option 2: Step Multiplication (Alternative)**

**Advantages:**
- ✅ Linear flow (no context switching)
- ✅ Clear progress indication
- ✅ Simple to implement

**Disadvantages:**
- ❌ Can make form feel very long
- ❌ Harder to go back and edit specific applicant
- ❌ Less flexible for partial completion

### **Recommended Data Strategy:**

Keep current structure but extend with co-applicant arrays:

```typescript
step3: {
  // Primary applicant (current structure)
  current_address: string;
  // ... existing fields
  
  // Co-applicants (new)
  co_applicants: Step3Data[]
}

step4: {
  // Primary applicant (current structure)  
  employment_status: string;
  // ... existing fields
  
  // Co-applicants (new)
  co_applicants: Step4Data[]
}
```

### **Next Steps:**

1. Create MultiApplicantWrapper component (✅ Done)
2. Update store types (✅ Done)  
3. Create Step3MultiApplicant component
4. Create Step4MultiApplicant component
5. Update navigation logic
6. Add completion tracking

### **Benefits of This Approach:**

- **Backward Compatible**: Existing single-applicant logic continues to work
- **Scalable**: Can handle any number of co-applicants
- **User-Friendly**: Clear visual cues and progress tracking
- **Maintainable**: Minimal changes to existing validation logic
- **Flexible**: Users can complete applicants in any order

Would you like me to proceed with implementing the tab-based multi-applicant forms for Steps 3 and 4?
